# HANDOFF

## Current Status

This project is a Stitch-generated design export for a premium iOS expense tracker.

The project currently contains:
- design screenshots
- several HTML prototypes
- a Stitch-generated design system file
- documentation files for future AI/developer handoff

There is not yet a full SwiftUI/Xcode app inside this export.

---

## Current Design Direction

The app should become a premium manual expense tracker inspired by:

- Quanto-style simple expense tracking
- Nike-style editorial/personalized app experience
- Apple Wallet / Apple Fitness / Apple Health polish
- SwiftUI-native interaction patterns

The product should feel:
- premium
- private
- clean
- dark-first
- fast
- personal
- App Store ready

## What Does Not Exist Yet

The project does not yet include:
- Xcode project
- native SwiftUI implementation
- Swift data models
- SwiftData persistence
- local database
- real import/export
- subscription/paywall implementation
- AI voice entry
- iCloud sync

---

## Recommended Next Tasks

### Step 1 — Review Design
- Open all screen PNGs.
- Choose the preferred direction between the original dashboard and the Nike/editorial dashboard.
- Decide final app name:
  - Numera
  - Clario
  - Lumio
  - Finora
  - or another name

### Step 2 — Create SwiftUI Project
- Create a new iOS app in Xcode.
- Minimum recommended target: iOS 17+.
- Use SwiftUI.
- Add folders:
  - `DesignSystem`
  - `Features`
  - `Models`
  - `Services`
  - `Resources`

### Step 3 — Implement Design System
Start with:
- colors
- typography
- spacing
- radius
- reusable cards
- money text
- buttons
- category chips
- transaction rows

### Step 4 — Build Core Screens
Recommended order:
1. Home
2. Add Transaction
3. Activity
4. Insights
5. Budget
6. Settings
7. Premium Paywall

### Step 5 — Add Data
Start with mock data.
Then add local persistence with SwiftData.

---

## Known Issues / Risks

- Stitch HTML is a design reference, not production SwiftUI.
- Current design name may still be temporary.
- App Store legal/privacy copy is not finalized.
- Premium plan pricing is placeholder.
- Some screens exist only as images and may not have matching HTML.
- No automated tests exist yet.
- No Git remote status is known from this export.

## Latest Session - 2026-07-01 (continued)

### Changed
- Added `TransactionStore` — in-memory transaction store (pre-seeded with MockData). Add/delete + per-month aggregates. All views now read from this store so adding a transaction immediately updates Home and Activity.
- Added `AppSettings` — shared `isPrivate: Bool` flag. Privacy toggle is now global; toggling in any view (or Settings) affects all views.
- Added `SettingsView` — shows user email/initials, Hide Balances toggle, version info, sign-out with confirmation.
- Wired all previously dead buttons:
  - Home "View Insights" → Insights tab
  - Home "SEE ALL" → Activity tab
  - Home "Details" (safe to spend) → Insights tab
  - Home month picker → sheet with last 6 months; data updates per month
  - AddTransaction Save → creates real Transaction in TransactionStore and dismisses
  - AddTransaction account pill → sheet with account list
  - AddTransaction date pill → DatePicker sheet
  - AddTransaction "VIEW ALL" → full category grid sheet
  - Insights "View spending details" → Activity tab
  - Insights "VIEW ALL" categories → Activity tab

### Files Touched
- `Numera/Services/TransactionStore.swift` (new)
- `Numera/Services/AppSettings.swift` (new)
- `Numera/Features/Settings/SettingsView.swift` (new)
- `Numera/App/ContentView.swift` (updated)
- `Numera/App/NumeraApp.swift` (updated)
- `Numera/Features/Home/HomeView.swift` (updated)
- `Numera/Features/AddTransaction/AddTransactionView.swift` (updated)
- `Numera/Features/Activity/ActivityView.swift` (updated)
- `Numera/Features/Insights/InsightsView.swift` (updated)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (updated)
- `HANDOFF.md` (updated)

### Tested / Checked
- Code written and reviewed; CI compile check will validate on push.
- All button targets verified: no dead `Button {}` closures remain.
- TransactionStore computed properties use `Decimal` matching Transaction.amount.

### Incomplete
- **`SupabaseConfig.swift` has placeholder values** — user must add real Supabase URL + anon key.
- Sign in with Apple needs entitlement enabled + Match cert regeneration.
- TransactionStore is in-memory only — data resets on each app launch; Supabase persistence is next.
- Insights data (weekly trend, cash flow, distribution) still uses hardcoded values; will need real aggregates from TransactionStore.
- Budget screen not yet built.
- Transaction detail / edit flow not yet built.
- Onboarding flow not yet built.

### Next
1. **User action required**: Add Supabase URL + anon key to `SupabaseConfig.swift`.
2. Enable Sign in with Apple in Apple Developer portal + add entitlement.
3. Wire transactions to Supabase (CRUD).
4. Replace InsightsView hardcoded numbers with live TransactionStore aggregates.
5. Build onboarding (first-run screens after sign-up).
6. Build budget screen.

### Git Status
- Branch: main
- Commits: auth layer + functional UI wiring
- Pushed: yes (this session)

---

## Latest Session - 2026-07-01 (auth)

### Changed
- Added Supabase Swift SDK to `project.yml` (`from: "2.0.0"`).
- Added `SupabaseConfig.swift` — placeholder URL + anon key. **User must replace before building.**
- Added `SupabaseManager.swift` — `SupabaseClient` singleton.
- Added `AuthManager.swift` — `@MainActor @Observable` auth state manager. Listens to `authStateChanges` stream for session updates. Methods: `signIn`, `signUp`, `signInWithApple`, `signOut`.
- Added `WelcomeView.swift` — landing screen with Sign in with Apple + Continue with Email.
- Added `EmailAuthView.swift` — sheet with sign-in/sign-up toggle, form validation, email confirmation card.
- Updated `NumeraApp.swift` — routes to `WelcomeView` (no session) or `ContentView` (signed in), after launch animation. Auth state resolved from Supabase local session cache within ~200ms.
- Fixed `ci.yml` — replaced `fastlane test` (broken — no test targets) with `xcodebuild build` compile check.

### Files Touched
- `project.yml` (added packages + target dependency)
- `Numera/App/SupabaseConfig.swift` (new)
- `Numera/App/NumeraApp.swift` (updated)
- `Numera/Services/SupabaseManager.swift` (new)
- `Numera/Services/AuthManager.swift` (new)
- `Numera/Features/Auth/WelcomeView.swift` (new)
- `Numera/Features/Auth/EmailAuthView.swift` (new)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (updated)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (updated)
- `HANDOFF.md` (updated)

### Tested / Checked
- Code written and reviewed; CI compile check will validate on push.
- Logic reviewed for `authStateChanges` stream correctness.
- `isLoading = true` at start; set to `false` on `.initialSession` → no flash of wrong screen.

### Incomplete
- **`SupabaseConfig.swift` has placeholder values** — user must add real project URL + anon key from Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API.
- **Sign in with Apple needs entitlement** — the Apple button and all Apple auth code is implemented. To activate it on device/TestFlight:
  1. Enable "Sign in with Apple" capability on the App ID in Apple Developer portal.
  2. Add to `project.yml` entitlements: `com.apple.developer.applesignin: [Default]`
  3. Run `fastlane refresh_certs` to regenerate the Match provisioning profile.
  This is a separate change; current build compiles fine without the entitlement.
- Settings screen is a placeholder.
- Budget screen not yet built.
- Transaction detail / edit flow not built.
- Onboarding flow (first-run steps after sign-up) not yet built.
- All data still reads from `MockData` — not yet wired to Supabase.

### Next
1. **User action required**: Add real Supabase URL + anon key to `SupabaseConfig.swift`.
2. Enable Sign in with Apple in Apple Developer portal + add entitlement to project.yml + regenerate Match certs.
3. Build onboarding flow (shown once after first sign-up).
4. Wire `AddTransactionView` to save real transactions to Supabase.
5. Replace `MockData` with live Supabase queries on Home, Activity, Insights.
6. Build Settings screen with sign-out button.
7. Build Budget screen.

### Tested / Checked
- All Swift files written; not compiled (Windows environment — Xcode required on Mac).
- File structure matches CLAUDE.md architecture spec.
- Design tokens match `luminous_ledger/DESIGN.md`.
- Privacy mode wired through `isPrivate` flag on MoneyText and TransactionRow.

### Incomplete
- No Xcode `.xcodeproj` or `Package.swift` file (these must be created in Xcode on a Mac).
- Plus Jakarta Sans font must be added to Xcode project Resources and `Info.plist`.
- `@AppStorage` or SwiftData persistence not wired — all screens read from `MockData`.
- Settings screen is placeholder only.
- Budget screen not yet built.
- Transaction detail / edit flow not built.
- Onboarding / splash not built.
- Privacy Face ID lock not built.
- Xcode Cloud CI/CD not yet connected (see `docs/CI_CD_SETUP.md`).

### Next
1. Open `Numera/` folder in Xcode on a Mac and create a new iOS App project pointing at this source.
2. Add Plus Jakarta Sans font files to `Resources/` and register in `Info.plist`.
3. Build and verify all four screens compile and render correctly.
4. Wire add transaction sheet to actually create `Transaction` objects (needs `@State` store or `@Observable` model).
5. Set up Xcode Cloud (see `docs/CI_CD_SETUP.md`).
6. Build Settings screen.
7. Build Budget screen.
8. Replace MockData reads with a `TransactionStore` `@Observable` class.
